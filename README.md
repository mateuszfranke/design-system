#### User stories
- I can see different button types: default, outline and text
- I can choose to disable box-shadow
- I can choose to disable button
- I can choose to have an icon on the left or right (Use Google Icon and at least 5 variants)
- I can have different button sizes
- I can have different colors
- I can see visual indicators
- I can still access all button attributes
- Show button in a similar way like the design or use Storybook. Otherwise, showing the button in multiple states is enough
